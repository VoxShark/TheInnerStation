cockroach = '''"I remember you." Alastor says as he looks at the small figure. Colored in sepia tones, this little body with the large console tv for a head was the very Vox he had first met.\nBack then, Vox was chipper and chatty, with bright eyes and delight as he shared a vision for a glorious world. Together they grew more powerful, learning more of this world.\n\n"Yep. I remember you too. But I'm not really here anymore. All my wonder, all my passion- gone. You left and I disappeared."\n He wasn't there anymore? Alastor thought of the things he had seen surrounding Voxtek, how it seemed to be cold and distant, and felt something in his heart ache. \nHad his disappearance really changed so much for the man?\n\n"I didn't mean to make you disappear. I had to go, I never had a choice."\n\n"That's where you're wrong, Allie. There is always a choice."\n'''
I_did = '''Perhaps there had been a choice. If he had stayed, if he had just talked to Vox that night, what would their lives be like?\nWould they be together, creating a Hell worth living, and living their new lives the way they wanted? Subconsciously he touched his throat, where his own collar sat.\nVox had offered freedom then, with only one catch- a relationship. A bond between them which kept them together. But any ties were a prison to Alastor.\n\nHow funny that Alastor’s pursuit in freedom resulted in a cage.\n\n”You’re right. At first I was certain I made the right call, but now- I have nothing but regret.”\n\n”So much regret you’ve kept it to yourself?” The little Vox said, looking up at Alastor with a puzzled face.\n\nThe Radio Demon wanted to lash out, to react in anger and defend himself, but they were right. All this time, Alastor hid away instead of reaching out to his one true friend.\n\n”I want to tell Vox the truth, Cockroach. What do I do?”\n\nCockroach smiled, a genuine warmth to his features which made Alastor’s heart skip. He missed those smiles.\n\n”You gotta find him. He’s in here, waiting.”\n\nCockroach stood, little shoes clacking against the street as he gestured to a building. It took only a moment for Alastor to recognize the door. The worn handle, the faded yellow color- it was their apartment door.\n\n”Is Vox there?” He asked, looking down at his companion.\n\n”Yes and no. A version of us is there, but if you want the main then you hafta understand the whole.”\n\nHe had to understand the whole? He could do this. He could find a way.\n\nAlastor gently caressed the top of the little TV’s head before going to the door. He hesitated only a moment before turning the handle and stepping through.'''
I_did_not = '''A choice? There was never a choice! They had been just fine the way they were, and then Vox decided to throw that surprise at Alastor. A future with him creating a company, but as more than business partners. He wanted a relationship!\n\nAlastor didn’t like restrictions and chains. He wanted to be free to make his decisions, and a relationship wasn’t freedom. It was a label weighing him down. Even if it was with Vox, he couldn’t do it.\n\n”No choice should restrict freedom and force labels where they aren’t needed, little friend.”\n\nAlastor’s words earned a scowl from little Cockroach, the small figure standing and stomping down the street. Alastor couldn’t help but chuckle at the clear tantrum, following after him.\n\n”Come on now, it isn’t as though I don’t care. I just… well, I require freedom.”\n\n Cockroach stopped, letting out an annoyed sigh.\n\n”Freedom? You want freedom? Okay. Then let’s see what freedom gets you.”\n\nThe little TV stomped his foot, not even looking at Alastor, and the ground beneath the Radio Demon gave way. The world around him became dark, cold, before shifting as he fell to the ground. The street was gone, a hallway now extending from him into shadow.\n\n”Okay then, I suppose that was fair,” Alastor grumbled to himself before rising to his feet.'''
Volo_apartment = '''There was a warmth in the space, and the sound of a vinyl spinning made him pause. Which song was it?\n\nLove is the sweetest thing\nWhat else on earth could ever bring\nSuch happiness to ev'rything\nAs Love's old story\n\nIt was Al Bowlly. Vox played it often when he was feeling sentimental. Did that mean-\n\n"Hi Al." A gentle tone, soft and tender, spoke from across the room. Vox sat there by the window, whiskey glass in hand. A second glass sat beside him.\n\n"Vox!" Alastor felt relieved, walking to greet his friend, and took the other whiskey glass to sit beside him.\n\nHe looked just as he did then. The large warm console, the yellow sweater, and an innocent expression which made Alastor feel safe. In all his existence on Earth or in Hell, this was the safest he had ever been.\n\n"Hello old pal." He said, red eyes looking from whiskey to man. Vox chuckled, then leaned back against the window.\n\n"Hey Alastor. I suppose you have questions."\n\n"Maybe a couple. For instance, how real is all this?" Alastor raised the glass to his lips, tasting the alcohol and recalling when they purchased the bottle.\n\n"Depends. This realm? It's complicated. But all of us in here? Well, we're real as it gets."\n\nReal. It was real. Vox was no longer the single whole man. He was split.\n\n"When you left, the stress inside took over and split us open. In total there are five of us." He drummed his fingers against the glass for a moment, studying Alastor's face before continuing.\n\n"There is of course me, the second form of Vox in Hell. The one you know best. My name is Violus. Then there's Volo, the one you used to call cockroach, the first form we took when we arrived in Hell. There is Vox, the entertainer and main front. The other two came after you left and the pain took hold."\n\nAfter he left? Was that to say that this split, all these other identities, were his fault? No way. No.\n\n"Vitiosus is all bark and some bite. You ran into him in the hall I think. But the one you need to watch out for is Vulnero. He's the protector and hates you the most."\n\nThey were talking together. The two of them could talk in here, like they used to, and Alastor wanted so much to stay. If he could stay here, with Violus, he would be happy again. He wouldn't feel pain again. If he just stayed.\n\n”I know that look. You’re thinking of running away.” Violus said with a frown, and Alastor’s ears folded back as he scowled at the man.\n\n'''
the_hallway = '''Alastor walked down the long hallway, each footstep seeming to echo in the space. There was a tension in the air, a crackle of energy, and the fur on his ears seemed to rise. \nA camera overhead seemed to follow him, but he ignored it. The camera would only see what he wanted it to see- or at least that was how it usually went.\n"Aren't you tired of it, Alastor?" Vox's voice made him jump, Alastor spinning on the spot. He couldn't see Vox, so where was he?\n\n"Tired of what, exactly?" He asked, looking for any trace of the TV Demon.\n\n"Being you? Being the one who is first to run away and last to stay. The one who breaks everything they touch."\n Alastor's ears flattened, the words striking him and causing a surge of anger to rise. Where was he, dammit! As he turned, for a moment he thought he spotted the man.\nSpinning in place, he saw nothing there, but there was a feeling of a light caress across his back as the Vox mocked him.\n\n"Not there~" He laughed, Alastor immediately spinning around just in time to see a brief flash of light. Vox had been right there.\n\n"What the hell is this? What do you even want?"\n\n"What do I want? Why Alastor, I'm so surprised at you. It's the same thing I have always wanted."\n\nAlastor turned in place, heart pounding, and his eyes met Vox's as the man stood a mere breath away. His screen was darker, his clothes seeming to ripple between dark blue and black, and he felt like a shadow of Vox.\n\n "I want you."'''
game_over =  '''Alastor hesitated too long. Suddenly a clawed hand grabbed him by the chin, forcing his gaze to lock with the one on the screen. All he could see was the great swirling red eye before his thoughts went blank. \n Alastor will never know the other parts to Vox, having become nothing more than the man’s puppet. \n Perhaps if he had gone another way things would be different.'''
he_ran = '''This wasn't his Vox. Not the man who he shared an apartment with. Who wore the yellow sweater and danced in the evening with him until the morning. This man- was a monster.\n\n"Where are you going, my dear? Have you forgotten where you are?" Vox's voice called behind Alastor.\n\nHow could Alastor forget? As he fled, he recalled the greeting from Vox. What had he called this place?\nThe Inner Station.\nWhy did that matter? Stations made different broadcasts. He had seen two forms of Vox since coming here, so what if there were more?\nHis mind was racing from thought to thought as he ran along the hall. Behind him, this darker Vox was laughing, pursuing him, and deep down Alastor knew if he were caught, he would never get out. That was when he saw two doors at the end of the hallway.'''
the_apartment = '''The apartment door promised safety and spoke of better days. Precious days where his smile was real! Once he pushed through, he slammed it closed behind him without hesitation.\nIt felt completely different from the hallway. There was a warmth in the space, and the sound of a vinyl spinning made him pause. Which song was it?\n\nLove is the sweetest thing\nWhat else on earth could ever bring\nSuch happiness to ev'rything\nAs Love's old story\n\nIt was Al Bowlly. Vox played it often when he was feeling sentimental. Did that mean-\n\n"Hi Al." A gentle tone, soft and tender, spoke from across the room. Vox sat there by the window, whiskey glass in hand.

The two of them could talk in here, like they used to, and Alastor wanted so much to stay. If he could stay here, with Violus, he would be happy again. He wouldn't feel pain again. If he just stayed.\n\n”I know that look. You’re thinking of running away.” Violus said with a frown, and Alastor’s ears folded back as he scowled at the man.'''
stay = '''I’m not running! I just… want to stay with you. Please. Just for a little while longer.” Alastor answered softly, looking at the man with a tender gaze.\n\nViolus looked back with tenderness and sorrow, but didn’t argue further. The Radio Demon began to discuss memories, times they went dancing, silly adventures they had, and there was laughter and warmth in the room.\n\nHow long did he stay, talking to his friend? Time didn’t matter here, so engrossed was he in the conversation. This was bliss and freedom, wasn’t it? This was what had been offered once.\n\nHe didn’t notice the apartment door open, nor the figure as it entered. Violus looked past Alastor, pain in his eyes, before he looked to his friend.\n\n”Goodbye, my friend.”\n\n'''
leave = '''Running felt so much easier. Avoiding the inevitable for as long as possible, dodging the things which hurt- it had been how Alastor had survived this long.\nBut survival wasn’t living, was it? Looking at his friend, he thought of the days in this apartment and how happy they had been.\nNeither of them were really living now, were they? And if Alastor ran again, if he just chose to avoid responsibility and stay here, what would happen?\n\n”You’re right,” Alastor sighed, downing his alcohol before placing the glass down. Violus looked surprised.\n\n”I do want to run away. I want to avoid all of this complicated mess. It’s easier to smile at your problems and walk away. But- I can’t leave you again.”\n\nHis companion watched him quietly as he spoke, taking him in before smiling with a warmth he fell for. Was it possible the man was proud of Alastor’s decision?\n\n”Well then friend, there’s only one thing to do.”\n\nViolus stood, placing his own glass aside as he went through the apartment to where their rooms had been. Following after him, Alastor hoped for a moment that the true Vox would be in his room waiting,\n\nbut such a thought had to be quickly pushed aside. There was a glow around the door, and Violus pushed it open.\n\n”I never stopped believing in you. Even in the darkness, I’ve wanted so much to dance in the light with you again. So please- don’t give up on us.”\n\n”I won’t. Not this time.” Alastor said the words without thought, a flush rising to his cheeks before he cleared his throat, straightened his tie, and stepped through the door.'''
voxtek_good = '''The apartment fell away behind him, the world no longer the warm memory of better days. Now, he stood within a cold space with hues of blue all around.\nThis had to be Voxtek, he couldn’t imagine any other place which could feel so distant. But where was Vox?\nWalking along hallways, employees wandered the space with distorted faces, as though the color of a TV had gone wrong and was nothing but waves and streaks. Was everyone like that to him now?\nThe Radio Demon felt frustrated as he continued to go in circles before spotting signs at the corner of a hallway. Executive offices, that had to be where Vox was!\n\nAlastor turned in the direction the sign indicated, a renewed vigor in his step, but as he walked he saw a flicker of words on the wall to his right.\n\nUseless. Pathetic. Unworthy.\n\nWhat was this? He paused for a moment, reaching out and touching the words. When he did, voices echoed in the space. His own, Valentino, Vox- all saying these things.\nWas this how he felt? Alastor swallowed, stepping back from the wall before walking again in the direction of the offices. It seemed every turn revealed more walls, more words, and more voices.\n\nFailure. Die. You deserve to be alone. Broken. Loser. End it all\n\nHelp.\n\nIt was that single word, soft and wavering, which made Alastor stop in their tracks. It wavered, and when he reached out to it the wall seemed to open up.\nHe slipped through, the wall closing behind him, and there behind a desk, sat Vox. His head was in his hands, shoulders heaving as those words seemed to echo in this space.\n\n”Help. Please.”\n\n”All you ever had to do was ask, old pal.” Alastor said softly, approaching him slowly with a tender expression.\n\nVox looked up from the desk, eyes wide and filled with disbelief. A smile formed as the room started to fall quiet except for Alastor’s steps until a hand placed itself on the back of Vox’s chair.\n\nWhere Vox was blues with some red, this figure was black. Even his screen was nothing but shadow, his smile reddened and twisted. Something inside Alastor immediately wanted to run.\n\n”He left usssss.” When this thing spoke, it didn’t use words so much as distorted static and digital screeches. It felt like knives in Alastor’s brain.\n\n”He did.” Vox replied, seeming to deflate. The light was leaving his face again.\n\n”I did leave, but it wasn’t your fault Vox.” Alastor argued, still slowly approaching.\n\n”Liar. Fault. Failure.” The hissing screeches said, pushing its twisted narrative.\n\nEvery time the thing talked, Vox seemed to withdraw more into himself. Alastor wanted this to stop, to help him, but whatever this thing was, it was dangerous.\nThis being hated Alastor, he could feel it, and he wondered to himself why.\n\n…the one you need to watch out for is Vulnero. He's the protector and hates you the most.\n\nViolus had told him that in the apartment. This thing, this figure behind Vox, had to be the last form. It had to be Vulnero.\n\n”It wasn’t your fault, Vox. It really wasn’t. I did this. I left because I was scared. All my life, I fought for what little I had.\nAnything I wanted came at a price. When I realized I wanted you- I was terrified. I’m so, so sorry.”\n\nVulnero bellowed, cables sprouting from his back and lashing out, striking Alastor and sending him flying. When he collided with the wall, he could hardly breathe from the pain.\nStill, he stood up, looking at Vox who seemed to have withdrawn so far into himself he was hardly present anymore.\n\n”I know I hurt you. I know I can’t take away that pain. But believe me when I say, I didn’t want to hurt you. I want us together, Vox. You and me, just like before.”\n\nAgain the cables lashed out, grabbing Alastor and slamming him to the ground. There was blood, he could taste it. Still, he couldn’t stop. Not this time.\n\n”I miss you, Vox. I miss us.” Again he approached, legs shaking as he drew closer to the desk. He was there, so close, and before Vulnero could strike again he closed the gap to throw his arms around the man, bypassing the desk for the hug.\n\n”I love you. You are wonderful, beautiful, and all the world to me.”\n\nHe anticipated Vulnero attacking again, but instead Vox’s arms slid around his body, pulling him close into a tight embrace. It warmed Alastor, making his heart pound as joy and fear blended together in an awkward mess.\nThis was happiness again. This was what he had been wanting.\n\n”Welcome home, Alastor.” Vox murmured, squeezing him gently.\n\nThe world seemed to fall away from the two of them, a dizzying whirl of movement becoming the space which held them, and Alastor closed his eyes to steady himself.\nWhen he opened them, they were in Vox’s office again, but this time he could hear the sounds of people in the building. The air felt lighter than before and the man in his arms felt more real than anything in his life. They were back.\n\nAlastor had wandered the Inner Station, determined to save himself at first, but found that by saving Vox he had saved his own future. Together they could find happiness and, just maybe, he would find freedom in this sweet submission.'''
voxtek_bad = '''While the door to the left had potentially promised safety, Alastor chose to go to the right, as perhaps this way he could find Vox and get out of this place faster.\nCharging through it, he slammed it closed behind him and leaned back, chest heaving with heavy breaths. What the hell was all that?\nThat was not his Vox, some sort of odd perversion of the man, and it terrified him. What could he do to get past this? Clearly this had started with Vox, it would end with him too.\n\nAlastor began walking, wandering about Voxtek with caution as he looked from one room to another. There was no one here, not a soul, and the emptiness pulled at him. Why was it like this?\n\nAlways he was running from something. From himself, from his dreams and desires- all for a supposed freedom which inevitably came with a collar.\nWhat good was a collared freedom, if he still had to answer the pull at the end of the day? It was frustrating, the Radio Demon hissing to himself in annoyance.\nNone of this was going to plan. Not that he had planned on coming to this place to begin with.\n\nAt an intersection of hallways, lights shut off to the right and left halls. His tail flagged, ears upright and swiveling as he listened.\nThere was no sound. Nothing but pure silence before an echoing like shoes against flooring. Then came a static and something shrill, like digitized screeching.\nWhatever it was, it terrified him.\n\nAlastor ran down one of the lit halls, trying different doors periodically to see if he could hide anywhere. Something had to give, there was no way he could just be trapped like this right?\nYet despite his attempts, not a single door opened. The lights further down the hall in the direction he had come from began to flicker before shutting off. The darkness was getting closer, the sound louder, and his fear grew.\nRun. His own shoes clacked loudly as he bolted, yet it seemed every time he sped up, so too did the ominous presence. Could he really not get away?\n\nThe answer came when he reached the end of the hall, hands fumbling with the door, trying the handle in desperation before he was surrounded by darkness.\n He wanted to beg, to cry, to scream- anything but be in the sudden silence. But then the screeching happened again, right behind him, and he screamed with it.\n\nThe door gave way, Alastor falling forward and crawling into the room. Behind him, a figure entered as low lights came on overhead. Where Vox was blues with some red,\nthis figure was black. Even his screen was nothing but shadow, his smile reddened and twisted. It was a polluted and twisted version of his friend, and he had to get away.\n\nWhen he tried to crawl forward, cables burst from the man’s back and wrapped around his legs, pulling him closer.\n\n”See what you havvvvvvve done?” Its voice, if it could be called a voice, was like the changing frequencies of a radio. High wines and low tones mixed with constant static.\n\nWhat had Alastor done? He hadn’t done a damn thing, he didn’t even want to be here, but the thing thought differently.\n\n”Help. Please.”\n\nA voice, Vox’s, spoke in the room. There, so close, was his former friend. He sat behind a desk, head in his hands, and seemed so small and withdrawn.\nThe obnoxious, boisterous personality was nothing in here.\n\nUseless. Failure. Monster. Loser.\n\nHissed words echoed in the space, and Vox withdrew even more into himself, body trembling. Alastor stared in horror at seeing his former friend, one he held dear, in this state.\n\n”Leave him alone!” Alastor shouted, struggling against the cables.\n\n”Alone? I am all he hassssss. You, Alasstorrrrr- you were the one who leftttt.”\n\nThe words cut at him, Alastor looking from Vox to this thing, to this beast which towered over him.\n\n”He waited all thissss time, yet you neeeever came. But you won’t leave again.”\n\nSuddenly a clawed hand grabbed him by the chin, forcing his gaze to lock with the one on the screen. All he could see was the great swirling red eye before his thoughts went blank. \n Alastor will never know the other parts to Vox, having become nothing more than the man’s puppet. \n Perhaps if he had gone another way things would be different.'''
