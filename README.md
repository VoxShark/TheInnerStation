# TheInnerStation
A class project where I have made a choose your own adventure game involving Vox and Alastor from Hazbin Hotel.

The concept goes with the headcanon shared between my partner and I that, due to the evolution of Vox's character, he has five personalities or 'channels'. Alastor knows three, but two of them are unfamiliar as they are from the time he left his partner behind.
