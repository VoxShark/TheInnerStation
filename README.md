A class project where I have made a choose your own adventure game involving Vox and Alastor from Hazbin Hotel.

The concept goes with the headcanon shared between my partner and I that, due to the evolution of Vox's character, he has five personalities or 'channels'. Alastor knows three, but two of them are unfamiliar as they are from the time he left his partner behind.

Warnings: Alcohol use, multiple-personality references, mild violence, mind-control, and manipulation.

The five personalities of Vox are as follows:
  Volo: This is what the fandom calls Cockroach, the little personality and first vesion of Vox. In this verse, this is the version Alastor first met in Hell when they were still in their own first form as a deer.

  Violus: The second form, the Vox of the 70s where he and Alastor lived together.

  Vox: The main personality. The entertainer and charmer.

  Vitiosus: The personality formed immediately after Alastor's disappearance. He is angry and in a state of denial over the abandonment.

  Vulnero: The protector. This is the darker shade of Vox, one who is more primal instinct than man and is all his trauma and rage.
